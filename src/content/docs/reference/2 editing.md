title: Editing the Astro Wiki
---
The Astro wiki is hosted as a website, not a traditional document or application. This makes regular updates somewhat cumbersome. To facilitate easy editing, I've intentionally kept it in an unfinished state. You can make your own changes directly to the wiki without the need to push it as HTML.

To edit the wiki:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to its directory.
2. Use the command `npm run dev` in your terminal.
3. This command will enable you to edit and preview changes locally.

Feel free to contribute and modify as needed to improve the content!
